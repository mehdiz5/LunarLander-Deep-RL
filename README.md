# LunarLander-Deep-RL

By : Mehdi Zakaria ADJAL

This project was done as part of the AI research internship recruitment project for InstaDeep. It focuses on training and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) agents to solve the **Lunar Lander** environment using deep RL methods such as DQN PPO.

Thank you InstaDeep for the opportunity.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehdiz5/LunarLander-Deep-RL.git
cd LunarLander-Deep-RL
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\\Scripts\\activate    # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements
Install all the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
Test the setup by running the following command:
```bash
python src/test/eval.py --help
```
If the help message of the evaluation script is displayed, the setup is successful.

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Training an RL Agent
Train a reinforcement learning model on the Lunar Lander environment using the following command:
```bash
python src/train/DQN.py --experiment_name lunar_exp --method DQN --timesteps 1000000 --mlp_architecture 512,256 --batch_size 64
```

- **`--experiment_name`**: Name of the experiment. Used to save the model and logs.  
- **`--method`**: The RL method, e.g., `DQN` or `PPO`.  
- **`--timesteps`**: Number of timesteps for training.  
- **`--mlp_architecture`**: Comma-separated sizes of hidden layers, e.g., `512,256`.

*Note : Additional arguments can be used for details use `python src/train/DQN.py --help`

### Evaluating a Trained Model
Evaluate a previously trained model using the following command:
```bash
python src/test/eval.py --experiment_name lunar_exp --method DQN --timesteps 1000000 --mlp_architecture 512,256 --batch_size 64
```
Make sure that a model with the same parameters exists in the appropriate saved directory.

*Note: Some pre-trained Agents are already saved in `/models`. You can evaluate them directly to save time, or delete them to test reproducibility*

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
-**`models/`** Contains saved models of different methods.
- **`src/`**: Contains the core source code for training and evaluation.
- **`src/train/`**: Script to train Agents.  
- **`src/test/eval.py`**: Script for evaluating trained RL agents.  
- **`src/custom_env.py`**: Contains the Custom env Wrapper for the bonus question.
- **`src/manual_playing.py`**: is just a script to manually play the game using the keyboard.
- **`src/manual_playing.py`**: Contains some fuctions such as the parser to avoid boilerplate code.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the project dependencies.

## âœ¨ Possible Extensions
- Add support for additional RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, A2C).
- Use tensorboard or wandb.
- Add flag files to check experiment status.
